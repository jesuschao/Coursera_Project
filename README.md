### PURPOSE.

The aim of this project is to carry out an analysis of some courses in "Coursera" website that could be very useful for people who want to build a career in data science or data analysis.

Some questions that may arise could be; 

1. When a student is going to choose a course, does it affect the learning level in their choice?

2. Is Coursera more focussed on beginners or on advanced learners?
    
3. What weights more on the studentÂ´s investment decision; rating's course or number of students?


After having assesed some datasets from Kaggle, it was decided that scrapping Coursera website (the method used has been "Selenium") was much a better option. This decision was based on the quantity and quality of the data obtained. 

After having cleaned and evaluated data, some interesting insights has been visualized with Power BI programm.
